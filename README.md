# PAC to Starfall Holos
A PAC > E2 > SF holo converter making use of my SF Holo Creator and E2 to SF Holo Converter

e2_to_sf_holo_v1.txt is an Expression 2 File \nholo creator v3.txt is a StarFall File

# How to use
1. Make the model in PAC3
2. Export as Expression 2 holos
3. Copy and paste the Hologram Data (the thing making all of the tables) into the Converter chip
4. Place converter chip
5. Open the console and copy the holo data that was just printed
6. Paste SF Holo Data into the CreationTable of Holo Creator V3

# Limitations
Currently Holo Creator V3 can only handle 1 clip per holo, V4 will be able to handle multiple clips.
The Converter Chip doesnt automatically put the SF Holo data into your clipboard, I'm trying to figure out something that doesnt use Antcore
